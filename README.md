Repository for paper ["Merging ‘Personas’ in Multi-Agent Systems of Language Models"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-G7_VIQlCG4z3rNwxG9NYgJrhQZVcXtb/view?usp=sharing).


Models were merged using merge-kit (https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit) and hosted on HuggingFace and are publicly accessible (https://huggingface.co/daiandy). 


Special thanks also to the paper ['Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate'](https://composable-models.github.io/llm_debate/). Much of our code was adapted from their repository (https://github.com/composable-models/llm_multiagent_debate).
